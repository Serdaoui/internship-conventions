# internship-conventions

I used UiPath to create a Bot that generates internship conventions from an excel file. First thing first is to extract data from an excel sheet, then create a Word
convention for each student, using a template, and finally convert them to pdf  We can use this Bot to fill out invoices too ;) or for any other purpose.
